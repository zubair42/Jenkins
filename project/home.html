Pocket Tanks is designed to be easy to learn, and fun to master.

 all the complicated details found in most artillery games.

The T4-B heavy tank was a multi-purpose tank used by the Rebel Alliance. The 
T4-B was armed with laser cannons which were effective against vehicles and 
concussion missile tubes which were effective against infantry, structures, 
turrets, etc.<br />
<br />
<span class="style2"><strong>&nbsp;Strengths</strong></span><br />
&nbsp;<br />
T4-B&#39;s were virtually good against anything and if they grouped together could 
be effective against AT-ATs. They could also run over infantry because of 
treads. They had weapons that were effective against just about everything and 
had thick armor.<br />
<br />
<span class="style2"><strong>&nbsp;Weaknesses<br />
</strong></span><br />
The T4-B had virtually no weaknesses, but one of them was low speed and short on 
maneuverability. They also took nearly ages to build on the galactic map. Even 
with two heavy vehicle factories, they still had a slow build time. <br />
<span class="style4"><br />
</span><span class="style2">Characteristics</span><br />
<br />
The T4-B was a multi-purpose tank, with virtually no weaknesses, they were 
durable, had thick armor, had a lot of firepower, and were effective against 
most vehicles and walkers. Because of the concussion missile launchers, it&#39;s 
ideally best to have these hang back with your artillery then when the enemy 
starts to close in have them switch to their powerful anti-armor laser cannons. 
You probably wont have to worry about infantry with these, as the rebels, your 
artillery should be able to mop up any infantry in nearly one round of fire. The 
cannons are generally best against shielded units and even unshielded units, 
especially 2-M Repulsor Tanks. The T4-B has the most effect against 2-M Repulsor 
Tanks, TIE Maulers, AT-ST&#39;s, and AT-AT&#39;s when in groups. </p>
